## Bug #2: Compile Error on Quick Start Page

### Problem:
- Error: "Failed to compile ./src/app/(authenticated)/quick-start/page.tsx:188:6"
- Happened after user signup
- Blocked application from running

### Root Cause:
- Missing closing `</div>` tag
- The conditional `{isWelcome ? ... }` block was inside a `<div className="text-center space-y-2">`
- But the div was never closed before the `<Card>` component started
- React expected the div to be closed

### Fix:
**File:** `src/app/(authenticated)/quick-start/page.tsx`

**Added closing div tag at line 217:**
```tsx
          )}
        </div>  // ← Added this closing tag

        {/* Main Card */}
        <Card className="card-enhanced">
```

### How to Test:
1. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Should compile without errors ✅
3. Navigate to /quick-start
4. Page should load properly
5. Try with `?welcome=true` parameter
