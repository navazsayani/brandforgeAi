## üé• Next Steps: Video Integration

### When Your Demo Video is Ready:

Replace this section in [`src/app/page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx) (around line 645):

```tsx
{/* Video Placeholder - You'll add your demo video here */}
<div className="mt-10 mb-8">
  <div className="relative w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/10 to-accent/10 rounded-xl border-2 border-primary/20 flex items-center justify-center">
    <div className="text-center p-8">
      <div className="w-20 h-20 mx-auto mb-4 bg-primary/20 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
        <svg className="w-10 h-10 text-primary" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20">
          <path d="M6.3 2.841A1.5 1.5 0 004 4.11V15.89a1.5 1.5 0 002.3 1.269l9.344-5.89a1.5 1.5 0 000-2.538L6.3 2.84z" />
        </svg>
      </div>
      <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Watch: AI Refinement in Action</p>
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">See how to transform "good" AI content into "perfect" in minutes</p>
      <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-4 italic">(Demo video coming soon - recording in progress)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**With this:**

```tsx
{/* Demo Video */}
<div className="mt-10 mb-8">
  <div className="relative w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto aspect-video rounded-xl overflow-hidden shadow-2xl border-2 border-primary/20">
    <iframe
      src="YOUR_VIDEO_URL_HERE"
      className="w-full h-full"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
      allowFullScreen
    />
  </div>
  <p className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-4">
    Watch how our AI Refinement Studio transforms content from "good" to "perfect" in minutes

## ‚ú® What Makes These Changes Work

5. **Clarity:** "From Good to Perfect" everyone understands

### SEO Strategy:
1. **Comparison pages** capture high-intent traffic
2. **Long-tail keywords:** "ai image refinement tool"
3. **Content depth:** Not just features, but WHY it matters

### Conversion Optimization:
1. **Removed friction:** "100% Free to Start" upfront
2. **Clear value prop:** Know exactly what makes you different
3. **Video placeholder:** Prime real estate for highest-impact element

## üéÅ Bonus: Social Media Post Templates

### LinkedIn Launch Post:
```
After 6 months building BrandForge AI, here's what makes us different:

```

### Twitter Thread:
```
I built an AI branding tool that doesn't suck.

Here's why it's different (thread) üßµ

1/ Most AI tools are one-shot:
You generate, don't like it, start over.
Repeat 10x until frustrated.

2/ BrandForge lets you REFINE:
"Make sky darker"
"Add mountains"
"Golden hour lighting"
Perfect in 3 steps, not 10 generations.

3/ It also LEARNS your brand:
Our RAG system remembers what works.
ChatGPT forgets everything.

4/ Free to try: [link]
```
