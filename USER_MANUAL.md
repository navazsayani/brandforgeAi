## 2. Core Features

### Brand Profile
This is the most crucial step. The information you provide here powers all the AI generation across the app.

- **Brand Name & Website URL:** Enter your brand's name and website.

### Content Studio
This is your creative workspace. It's organized into three tabs:

1.  **Image Generation:**
    - Create unique images based on your brand description and style notes.
    - You can optionally use one of your uploaded Brand Profile images as a structural reference.

    - Generate engaging captions and hashtags for Instagram.
    - You can choose to generate a text-only post or associate it with an image from your library or a newly generated one.
    - The AI can also describe your selected image for you to provide better context for the caption.
    - Use "AI Quick Start" to populate the form from a simple request.

3.  **Blog Post:**
    - **Generate an Outline:** First, use the AI to generate a structured, SEO-friendly outline for your blog post based on a simple idea.
    - **Edit & Refine:** You can edit the outline to fit your exact needs.
    - **Generate Content:** Once you're happy with the outline, click "Generate Blog Post" to have the AI write the full article.
