## Make a free logo look professional

- Start with a simple, ownable shape; avoid overused stock icons.
- Test at small sizes (24–48px) and in monochrome for clarity.
- Align spacing and proportions; use a grid or consistent padding.
- Choose one primary typeface; avoid mixing too many fonts.
- Export SVG for scalability; PNG with transparency for web.

## When free isn’t enough

- You need a trademarkable, unique mark in a crowded niche.
- You want a full identity system (typography, color, usage).
- You need file hygiene: precise curves, optical adjustments, kerning.
In these cases, hire a designer or use a hybrid flow: generate concepts with AI, then have a pro refine vectors.
