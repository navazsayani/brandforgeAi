## Recommended workflows

- AI-first concepting, then vector polish
  1. Use an AI tool (e.g., BrandForge AI) to generate 3–5 directions.
  2. Pick the strongest idea; bring it into a vector editor (Figma, Linearity Curve, Illustrator).
  3. Simplify paths, adjust proportions, and finalize spacing/kerning.
  4. Export SVG + PNG and test at small sizes.

- Mobile-first creation
  1. Draft in Canva on iOS/Android; keep shapes simple and bold.
  2. Export PNG; if you need SVG, upgrade or re-create vectors in Figma/Linearity Curve.
  3. Build a mini brand kit (colors, fonts, spacing) for consistency.

## Make your app-made logo look pro

- Use a simple, ownable silhouette; avoid complex details.
- Test at 24–48px and in monochrome for clarity.
- Align to a grid; keep optical balance (counterspace, symmetry).
- Limit to 1 icon + 1 typeface; manage letter spacing carefully.
- Export: SVG (primary), PNG 512–1024px (web), PDF (print).
