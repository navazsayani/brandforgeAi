You can design a simple, crisp logo in Photoshop using shape layers, smart guides, and careful exports. While Illustrator or Figma are better for pure vectors, Photoshop can still produce professional, production-ready logo assets when you keep the design minimal and use shape layers.

## TL;DR

- Keep it simple: bold silhouette, minimal detail, strong contrast.
- Use vector shape layers (not raster brushes) so edges stay sharp.
- Align with grids and smart guides for symmetry and spacing.
- Export PNG (transparent) for web; hand off paths to a vector tool for SVG.
- Test legibility at small sizes (24–48px) and in monochrome.

## Before you start: Define the idea

- Brand purpose and vibe: modern/minimal? friendly/playful? premium/classic?
- Shape direction: mascot/icon, monogram, abstract mark?
- Constraints: single color vs two-tone, small-size legibility

## Step-by-step Photoshop workflow

### 1) Create the canvas
- File → New → 2048×2048 px (square), 300 ppi.
- Background: Transparent.
- View → Rulers (Cmd/Ctrl+R), View → Show → Grid, and enable Snap/Smart Guides.

Why: Large, square canvas keeps angles precise and simplifies exports.

### 2) Set up a simple grid
- Edit → Preferences → Guides, Grid & Slices.
- Gridline every 64 px, subdivisions 8.
- Add center guides (drag from rulers).

Why: Consistent spacing and symmetry make the logo feel professional.

### 3) Build with vector shapes
- Use Shape tools (U) set to Shape (not Pixel).
- Start with basic geometry (circle, rectangle, polygon) and combine with Path Operations (Add, Subtract, Intersect).
- Keep corners clean and avoid micro-detail.

Tip: For a monogram, use a geometric sans font; convert to shape (Right-click layer → Convert to Shape) and refine anchors with the Path Selection tool (A).

### 4) Balance and alignment
- Select layers → use align tools (top, vertical center, horizontal center).
- Maintain consistent negative space and stroke weights.
- Mirror-check: Duplicate, flip horizontally (Edit → Transform → Flip Horizontal) to catch asymmetry.

### 5) Color and contrast
- Start in monochrome (pure black on transparent).
- If using brand colors, set as Solid Color fill layers so you can tweak later.
- Keep 1–2 colors max for clarity and easy small-size rendering.

### 6) Small-size and monochrome test
- View the mark at 48 px and 24 px (Window → Navigator or zoom).
- Turn off color layers to test black-only.
- If details vanish, simplify shapes or increase contrast.

### 7) Prepare exports
- Keep the master document layered and vector (shape layers).
- For web/app:
  - File → Export → Export As → PNG, Transparency on, 512–1024 px.
- For print or vector workflows:
  - Right-click each shape layer → Copy Shape Path; paste into Illustrator or Figma to finalize true SVG curves.
  - Alternatively, File → Export → Paths to Illustrator to move vector paths.

Note: Photoshop’s SVG export is limited and may flatten or approximate curves. For clean SVGs, finish vectors in Illustrator, Figma, or Inkscape.

## Pro tips for logo quality

- Simplify: One icon idea, one weight, one typeface (if any).
- Optical corrections: Slightly adjust overshoots and spacing by eye, not just numerically.
- Geometry first: Build with primitives; boolean combine for precision.
- Consistent radii: Keep corner radii related (e.g., base radius ×2 for larger arcs).
- Negative space: Ensure interior cutouts read clearly at 24–48 px.

## Export checklist

- Transparent PNG at 1024 px and 512 px
- Monochrome variant (black) and inverted (white on dark)
- Square canvas, centered icon with safe padding
- Optional: hand off vector paths to Illustrator/Figma and export SVG

## FAQ

Q: Should I design a logo in Photoshop or Illustrator?
A: Illustrator/Figma are best for vectors. Photoshop is fine if you stick to shape layers and export PNG, then hand off to a vector editor for final SVG.

Q: How do I keep edges crisp?
A: Use Shape layers (vector), align to pixel grid where needed, avoid raster brushes for edges.

Q: Can I export SVG from Photoshop?
A: Limited and unreliable for complex shapes. Copy shape paths into Illustrator/Figma and export SVG there.

Q: How big should my logo export be?
A: 512–1024 px PNG covers most web needs. Keep a layered PSD master and a true SVG from a vector app for scalability.
